# a lazyvim fork 
Forked from the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Not much on top of stock, but it works well for me.
One invaluable tweak is getting the lsp to detect and apply .clangd configs for a directory.
Neogit is also nice.


# my 2c
LazyVim has a lot of noise initially, and seems counter to the aims of not using a more mainstream editor (vs code) but overall its the closest to a CLI based IDE I've seen while still feeling extremely lightweight/snappy.
